# Python Natural Language Processing
This is the code repository for [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9780596803346/pr02.htmlISBN: 978-0-596-51649-9),
published by Oreilly. It contains all the supporting project files necessary
to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By “natural language” we mean a language that is used
for everyday communication by humans; languages such as English, Hindi, or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial
languages such as programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from
generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing—or
NLP for short—in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could
be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves
“understanding” complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.



## Usage* This is for my personal use and documentation for brushing up on NLP.

* TODO - In process - Updated script for jupyternotebook, python3 and colab imports due to deprications since 2017 when first written
* needed to upload the csv manually as google colab is not very efficent


## In Development

* Add coverage tests
  Check tests with `tox`.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

NLTK-Data
This contains the linguistic corpora that are analyzed and processed in the book.

The code will look like the following:
```
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import brown as cb
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg as cg
```

The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK includes extensive software, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from http://www.nltk.org/
